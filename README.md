## BIO726P Cheat Sheet


### Instructor Guidance

The practicals in this module are sequential and build upon one another. If a student misses a session, falls behind, or joins the module late, it may affect their ability to complete later practicals.

To help students catch up, please follow the steps below:

### Steps

1) Identify what practicals have not been successfully completed by the student. 

2) For each missing practical download the relevant tarball to your local machine. (Sadly you cannot download the file directly into the students Virtual machine)


3) Once downloaded scp the tarball into the students VM.  

4) Then log into the students VM and decompress it with the following command:
`
tar -xzvf <Practical_ID>.tar.gz
`
